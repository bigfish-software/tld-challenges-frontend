# Test Banner vs. Production Appearance

When using Google's test key, a warning banner appears in the captcha:

![Test reCAPTCHA with Banner](https://i.imgur.com/UVgwS0f.png)

With your own site key, the banner disappears and you'll see a clean captcha:

![Production reCAPTCHA](https://i.imgur.com/q9nbgz0.png)

The test key is fine for development, but you should always use your own registered site key for production deployments.
