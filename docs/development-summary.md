## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Component Development Process
1. Create component with TypeScript
2. Create Storybook stories for all variants
3. Test component in isolation with Storybook
4. Write unit tests based on Storybook stories
5. Document component usage and guidelines

### Theme Implementation

- Implement `ThemeProvider` context
- Create theme-aware components with dual variants
- Test all components in both light and dark themes

### Storybook Integration
- Component showcase and documentation
- Interactive testing with user interactions
- Theme variant testing (light/dark comparison)
- Accessibility testing integration

## üîß Technical Specifications
